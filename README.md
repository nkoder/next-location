## Setup project for development (on Ubuntu 14.10)

Install Node.js 0.10 or newer. Then run following command from the project directory:

1. `npm install` to install dependencies

2. `npm start` to prepare project in `dist` folder and serve it under [http://localhost:8000/index.html]()

## Deploy to Github Pages

From the project directory run `npm run deploy`
     
This command is not polished and typically an error occurs. A workaround is to force push.

        cd .publish
        git push --force origin gh-pages
        cd ..
        rm -rf .publish
